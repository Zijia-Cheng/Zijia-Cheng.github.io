Recently I have been working on a project that involving dealing with pretty complicated crystal structures and BZs. Having tired of working out bulk BZ and surface BZ for each crystal, I wrote a python script to do it for any structures. The script is surprisingly simple, and detailed code can found [here](https://github.com/Zijia-Cheng/DrawBZ). The project has been starred by 24 people. Glad that people find it useful!
